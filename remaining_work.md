# Remaining Workflow Tasks

The current repository includes 35 endpoint fixtures. Recent updates added several missing fixtures, corrected the SSO template ID, captured a successful `createPolicy` response, and converted all Microsoft fixtures to pure JSON. However, some tasks from the original requirements remain incomplete:

- **Error fixture replacements**: All Microsoft Graph fixtures now have successful responses.
- **Data extraction tests**: No automated checks validate data extraction patterns for primary domain, service accounts, role assignments, SAML profiles, or Azure app IDs.
- **Edge case coverage**: There are no fixtures capturing pagination, rate limiting, or long-running operations.
- **Validation report**: A consolidated report outlining each endpoint's success schema and prerequisites has not been produced.

To fully satisfy the workflow coverage goals, capture working responses for the remaining endpoints, implement extraction tests, add edge-case fixtures, and document results in a validation report.
